# Sunshine

This is my first SwiftUI project, as I decided not to release it to the App Store. I made the codebase available here for anyone to take a look at.
It can serve as a good example or template to anyone looking to build a weather app.

## Instructions

You can try out the app on your own device. For that you will need to:

1. Register to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) and get a token for the **One Call API** (very important as the app is based on the spec of this API)
2. Clone this repository
3. Add the OpenWeatherMap token to `WeatherAPIClient.swift` line 145
4. Compile and run the app on a device or the simulator

## Notes

- Sunshine works almost flawlessly from iOS 14 to iOS 14.3.
- This project is stopped, so I won't do any maintenance. I won't reply to most issues if any at all.
- Some weather assets are missing, some others are not animated, this is because I stopped working on this project before being able to tackle those.
